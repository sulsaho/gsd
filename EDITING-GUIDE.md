### Step 3: Make your changes
You can change:

## How to Add a New Service

### Step 1: Find the right ministry and department
Open `src/data/services.json` and search for the ministry and department where this service belongs.

### Step 2: Copy an existing service
Find a similar service and **copy the entire block** from `{` to `}` including the commas.

### Example - Adding "Dental License":
```json
{
  "id": "health-licensing",
  "name": "Licensing & Registration",
  "icon": "certificate",
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "medical-license",
      "name": "Medical Professional License",
      "description": "License for doctors, nurses, etc",
      "requirements": [
        "Bachelor's degree in medical field",
        "Pass licensing exam"
      ],
      "processingTime": "4-6 weeks",
      "cost": "D2,500",
      "contactName": "Licensing Department",
      "contactPhone": "+220-439-2072",
      "contactEmail": "licensing@health.gm",
      "officeAddress": "123 Health Building, Kairaba Avenue, Banjul",
      "officeHours": "Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 4 PM"
    },
    {
      "id": "dental-license",
      "name": "Dental Professional License",
      "description": "License for dentists and dental hygienists",
      "requirements": [
        "Dental degree from accredited institution",
        "Pass dental board exam",
        "Police clearance certificate"
      ],
      "processingTime": "4-6 weeks",
      "cost": "D2,500",
      "contactName": "Licensing Department",
      "contactPhone": "+220-439-2072",
      "contactEmail": "licensing@health.gm",
      "officeAddress": "123 Health Building, Kairaba Avenue, Banjul",
      "officeHours": "Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 4 PM"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Important things to remember
- **Add a comma** after the previous service's closing `}`
- The `"id"` must be **unique** (use lowercase with hyphens, e.g., "dental-license")
- Keep the same structure (don't remove any `"` or `:` or `{` or `}`)
- The last service in a list should NOT have a comma after its closing `}`

## Tips and Common Mistakes

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always keep the double quotes `"` around text
- Add commas between items in a list
- Use a JSON validator to check your file: https://jsonlint.com
- Make a backup before making big changes
- Test locally with `npm run dev` before pushing

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Remove or add extra `{` or `}` or `[` or `]`
- Forget commas between items
- Add a comma after the last item in a list
- Use special characters without escaping them
- Change the `"id"` of existing services (this will break links)

### Common Errors:

**Missing comma:**
```json
{
  "name": "Service 1"
  "cost": "D100"  ‚Üê WRONG! Missing comma after "Service 1"
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "name": "Service 1",
  "cost": "D100"
}
```

**Extra comma at the end:**
```json
{
  "services": [
    { "id": "service-1" },
    { "id": "service-2" },  ‚Üê WRONG! Last item shouldn't have comma
  ]
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "services": [
    { "id": "service-1" },
    { "id": "service-2" }
  ]
}
```

## Need Help?

1. **Validate your JSON:** Copy and paste your entire `services.json` file into https://jsonlint.com to check for errors
2. **GitHub will warn you:** If there's an error, GitHub will show a warning before you commit
3. **Check the browser console:** Press `F12` in your browser and look for error messages
4. **Compare with the original:** Look at the examples in this guide or the existing services
5. **Undo changes on GitHub:** Go to the file history (click "History" button) and restore a previous version

## Quick Reference: Service Template

Copy this template when adding a new service:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-service-id",
  "name": "Service Name Here",
  "description": "Brief description of what this service does",
  "requirements": [
    "First requirement",
    "Second requirement",
